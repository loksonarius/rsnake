# RSnake

_Snake clone done in Rust_

![Sample Game](https://i.imgur.com/ObGkhfH.gifv)

Forked from [Tensor Programming's
snake-tutorial](https://github.com/tensor-programming/snake-tutorial)

## Running

Running the game:

```bash
cargo run
```

Building executable:

```bash
cargo build
```

## Purpose

This project is here to give me some starting material to learn the Rust
language. I figured this might be more productive than just bashing my head in
with a new project from scratch and lets me focus on learning the language
instead of designing some system.

I'll be adding on to the existing code base as I get more comfortable with
things. I'll be recording progress on this below.

## Progress

- [X] Add flashing fruit
- [ ] Add score counter
- [ ] Add header bar with score
- [ ] Make fruit dissapear over time
- [ ] Add eating sound effect
- [ ] Add home screen
